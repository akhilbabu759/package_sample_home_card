## Usage

TODO:Basic usage: To create a basic HomeCard widget, you can pass in the required parameters for the image URL, banner text, card height, and banner color. Here's an example:

less
Copy code
HomeCard(
  imag: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
  text: 'Example Text',
  height: 200,
  bannerColr: Colors.blue,
)
No image available: If you want to handle cases where the image URL is null or invalid, you can display a fallback message instead of the image. Here's an example:

php
Copy code
HomeCard(
  imag: null,
  text: 'Example Text',
  height: 200,
  bannerColr: Colors.blue,
)
In this case, the Text widget "image not available" will be displayed instead of an image.

Copy code
HomeCard(
  imag: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
  text: 'Custom Banner Text',

)
